      // The object class represents one of JavaScriptâ€™s data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor. we have two types of values used in JavaScript- primitive and reference. To be more simple, either we create objects or primitive data types. The primitive data types are as follows-
      let myVar = 34;
      let myvar2 = String;
      let myvar3 = true;
      let myvar4 = null;
      let myvar5 = undefined;
      // Apart from primitive data types, all the other are objects. Let us now see how to define objects. If we write as follows-

      //   let employe = {
      //     name: "utkarsh",
      //     salary: 5121,
      //     chaneel: "codewithharry",
      //     chaneel1: "geeks for geek",
      //   };
      //   console.log(employe);

      //   There is a special kind of object known as Arrays. The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high level, list-like objects. An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

      // We can declare an array as follows-

      //   let names = [1, 2, 3, 4, "harry", undefined];
      //let names = new Array(23, 45, "java", "c++", "css");
      let names = Array(23);
      console.log(names.length);
      names = names.sort();
      names.push("This is pushed");
      console.log(names);
